# DiscoverNUS
Orbital Project for mobile AR app

## Introduction
Navigating a large campus like NUS can be daunting for visitors. Our Augmented Reality (AR) app provides seamless navigation assistance, guiding users to key points of interest, facilities, amenities, and nearby attractions through intuitive AR markers and directional cues. Furthermore, by gamifying the campus exploration experience, we aim to make it more enjoyable and engaging for visitors. Users will embark on quests and challenges that encourage them to explore different parts of the campus while discovering interesting landmarks and hidden gems.

## Tech Stack
Swift - Swift is the official language for macOS and iOS development. Due to the prevalence of iPhones among the NUS student population, we would like to develop our app to cater to the iOS community, which would benefit a large number of the student population, which is our target audience <br>
Firebase - Firebase is a real-time NoSQL database, which provides email/password authentication solutions, and is highly compatible with Swift. <br>
